/*
The procedure performs the following operations:
- computes the number of total and successful checks performed by the bot
  for each team and service (thus for each active flag) in the current round;
- computes the score for the current round for each team;
- clears active_flags and integrity_checks tables in order to start with the
  next round.

Formulae used for scores computation of the current round (per service):
- integrity = #upChecks / #n_checks
- attack = #attacks
- defense = int((0 if integrity < 0.8 else integrity) * (#teams - 1 - #attacks_received))
*/
