"""
The ctf swiss army knife: round initializer, flag dispatcher, service checker

This program can be used in three different modes, depending on the current
task we want to execute.

In advance mode, the script calls a stored procedure to prepare the database
for a new round and inserts fresh flags for all the service, team pairs. In
dispatch mode, all the flags are sent to the teams' vms by calling an external
script. In check mode, each service is tested by executing a script that
performs a safe access and retrieves the flag. The return code of the script
represents the status of the service, which is then saved into the database for
being used later during the score computation phase.
