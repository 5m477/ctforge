<p class="lead"><strong>CCIT CTF '18</strong> is the final Capture The Flag contest of the CyberChallenge.IT training program. It's now time to prove your skills!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-justify"><p>A Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. There are two main styles of capture the flag competitions: jeopardy and attack/defense.</p>

<p>Jeopardy-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity of correct submissions over the timing.</p>
<p>In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines.</p>
