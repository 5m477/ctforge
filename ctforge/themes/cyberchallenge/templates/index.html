<p class="lead"><strong>CCIT CTF '18</strong> is the final Capture The Flag contest of the CyberChallenge.IT training program. It's now time to prove your skills!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-justify"><p>A Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. There are two main styles of capture the flag competitions: jeopardy and attack/defense.</p>

<p>In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines.</p>

The theme of this CTF is <strong>Underwater Life</strong>! <br>
It's the year 2104, after the melting of polar ice caps, see levels have covered
the majority of Earth continents. The remains of human civilization live in big
underwater communities since, on the land, pollution and radiations made living
on the surface unbearable.
In 2097 the first operational underwater city was made possible by the work of
John D. Rockefeller, that through his network of pumps, gave humanity a new hope.
