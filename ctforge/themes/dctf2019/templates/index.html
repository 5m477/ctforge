<p class="lead">Deep Space <del>DAIS</del> CTF (DCTF) is a Capture The Flag hacking contest
    in which a number of alien races fight independently against each other in
    order to tower over the galactic empire.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>The goal of each team is to maintain a set of services such that they
            remain available and uncompromised throughout the contest. Each team also has
            to attempt to compromise the other teams' services. Since all the teams have
            access to a copy of the same virtual machine containing the vulnerable
            services, each team has to find vulnerabilities in its host and fix them
            without disrupting the services.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>At the same time, the teams have to leverage their knowledge about the
            vulnerabilities they find to compromise the servers run by other teams.
            Compromising a service allows a team to bypass the service's security
            mechanisms and to "capture the flag" associated with the service. The team
            that has the best combination of attack and defense skills wins.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>In parallel with the main contest, a number of side challenges are
            left to be solved to the bravest participants. Since points earned by
            solving challenges do not contribute to the score of the teams,
            these problems must be solved individually.</p>
