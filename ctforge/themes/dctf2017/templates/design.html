<p>The game is played within a VPN in the <code>10.0.0.0/16</code> subnet. Each team has its own vulnerable machine located at <code>10.0.&lt;team_id&gt;.1</code>, while players connecting to the VPN network are assigned an ip in the range <code>10.0.&lt;team_id&gt;.150 - 10.0.&lt;team_id&gt;.200</code>. VMs can be accessed also via the DNS name <code>team&lt;team_id&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The <i>manager</i> machine is responsible for dispatching flags to the vulnerable machines, checking services integrity, hosting the scoreboard (this website) and updating scores.</p>

<p>Players are not allowed to attack each other (e.g., you can't break into rivals' laptops). The only permitted attack targets are the vulnerable machines. Teams have limited Internet access to install new software on the VM, if needed. Beware that if you mess up your vulnerable machine, all we can do is reset it to its original state (backup your exploits and patches!).</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Scoring System. <span class="text-muted">Take the lead.</span></h2>
<p>The game is divided in <b>rounds</b> having the duration of {{ config.ROUND_DURATION }} seconds. At the beginning of each round, a bot will renew all the flags in your vulnerable machine. Moreover it will check the integrity of services several times in a round by interacting with them and by retrieving the flags through legitimate accesses. Please do not remove the 3 ssh public keys listed below from <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> otherwise your services may result inaccessible to the checkbot.</p>

<p>Your team gains points by attacking other teams and defending its own vulnerable machine. For each valid flag submitted by your team, the attack score is increased. On the other hand, you lose defense points for each attack inflicted to your vulnerable machine. For each service, the defense points are multiplied by an integrity factor, defined as the ratio of number of successful checks and the total number of checks performed by the integrity bot during a single round. If the integrity factor is below the threshold of <code>0.8</code>, the service is marked as corrupted and your team gains 0 points in that round which is equivalent to being attacked on that particular
service by all teams. Note also that a flag of a given service can be submitted only if the corresponding service on your vulnerable machine is not corrupted.</p>

<p>To recap, the scores of a service in a round are computed according to the following formulae:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>attack = #attacks</code></li>
    <li><code>integrity = #successful_checks / #checks</code></li>
    <li><code>defense = (0 if integrity &lt; 0.8 else integrity) * (#teams - 1 - #attacks_received)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>A flag is considered valid if it has been dispatched by the flagbot in the current round. Old flags are discarded by the flag submission system. The total score of each team is given by <code>0.6 * attack + 0.4 * defense</code>, where attack and defense are expressed as a percentage of the best scores achieved among the teams.</p>

<p>Please notice that services may (or may not) include multiple vulnerabilities. Do not stop the security analysis of applications after
finding the first simple issue. Complex vulnerabilties have an higher chance of being left unpatched.</p>

    <div class="col-md-7">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Flags. <span class="text-muted">Catch 'em all!</span></h2>
<p>A flag is a string made up of <code>{{ config.FLAG_PREFIX }}</code>, followed by {{ config.FLAG_LENGTH }}
random characters in the set <code>{{ config.FLAG_CHARS }}</code>, ending with <code>{{ config.FLAG_SUFFIX }}</code>. It is matched by the regular expression <code>{{ config.FLAG_REGEXP }}</code>.</p>

<p>To manually submit a flag, click on the <a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">flag submission service</a> entry in the top-right menu and enter the flag in the provided form. During the CTF, anyway, you may want to automatically submit flags in order to keep the exploitation going while you are not connected. To do so, you can submit stolen flags by performing an HTTP POST request to <code>{{ url_for('submit') }}</code>. The request must contain the keys <code>flag</code> and <code>team_token</code>, where the values of the first entry is the stolen flag and <code>team_token</code> is a string that allows the server to identify your team. The token of your team can
be found in the <a href="{{ url_for('team') }}">team page</a>. <strong>Important: do not perform user authentication whilst submitting flags, this is not needed and may overload our servers</strong>.</p>

<p>As an example, we provide a simple python snippet that accounts for the submission of an hardcoded flag.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import requests

url = 'http://10.0.254.1/submit'
team_token = '&lt;insert your token here&gt;'
stolen_flag = 'dctf{qwertyuiop123456789asdfg}'
 
r = requests.post(url, data={'team_token': team_token, 'flag': stolen_flag}, verify=False)</code></pre>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Rules. <span class="text-muted">Obey or get obliterated.</span></h2>
<p>Below, you'll find the current list of rules. These may change as more issues are raised by the participants. Also, the organizers have the right to change any rule (as well as the structure of the competition) at any time. Keep in mind that it is not possible/feasible to list all the rules and the exceptions to rules that apply to the CTF competition. When in doubt, use common sense or ask to us.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It is forbidden to launch denial-of-service (DOS) attacks</li>
    <li>Please no floods, no DNS poisoning, no ARP spoofing, no MITM</li>
    <li>Destructive behavior and unfair practices are severely prohibited. These include removing flags or deleting files on compromised hosts, creating fake flags to break legitimate attacks and sharing attacks or flags</li>
    <li>Vulnerability/network scanners are not allowed</li>
    <li>Do not attack this website and do not try to break the scoring system</li>
    <li>If you find a way to hack into a service/challenge more easily than intended, please report it to the organizers for extra points</li>
    <li>Teams or individuals breaking these rules might be penalized or excluded from the competition</li>
</ul>
<p>Before attempting to break one of the aforementioned rules, remember that
all the traffic generated within the VPN network is logged. <b>Vaporizing a
team is just one click away</b>.</p>
